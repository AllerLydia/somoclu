### Somoclu
Somoclu is a cluster-oriented implementation of self-organizing maps. It relies on MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be accelerated by CUDA on a GPU cluster. A sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining processes.

### Usage
Somoclu takes a plain text input file. The dense format should include an instance in one row. The sparse format follows the libsvm sparse matrix format. Example files are included.

[mpirun -np NPROC] somoclu [OPTIONs] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_PREFIX

Arguments:

     -e NUMBER     Maximum number of epochs
     -k NUMBER     Kernel type
                      0: Dense CPU
                      1: Dense GPU
                      2: Sparse CPU
     -s            Enable snapshots of U-matrix
     -x NUMBER     Dimension of SOM in direction x
     -y NUMBER     Dimension of SOM in direction y

Examples:

     somoclu data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs
     mpirun -np 4 somoclu -k 0 -x 20 -y 20 data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs

### Install
Run ./autogen.sh, ./configure, and make to compile the program. Note that MPI is required. CUDA support is optional. See also ./configure --help.
