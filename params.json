{"body":"### Somoclu\r\nSomoclu is a cluster-oriented implementation of self-organizing maps. It relies on MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be accelerated by CUDA on a GPU cluster. A sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining processes.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nSomoclu takes a plain text input file. The dense format should include an instance in one row. The sparse format follows the libsvm sparse matrix format. Example files are included.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[mpirun -np NPROC] somoclu [OPTIONs] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_PREFIX\r\n```\r\nArguments:\r\n```\r\n     -e NUMBER     Maximum number of epochs\r\n     -k NUMBER     Kernel type\r\n                      0: Dense CPU\r\n                      1: Dense GPU\r\n                      2: Sparse CPU\r\n     -s            Enable snapshots of U-matrix\r\n     -x NUMBER     Dimension of SOM in direction x\r\n     -y NUMBER     Dimension of SOM in direction y\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n     somoclu data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs\r\n     mpirun -np 4 somoclu -k 0 -x 20 -y 20 data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nRun ./configure and make to compile the program. Note that MPI is required. CUDA support is optional. See also ./configure --help.\r\n","tagline":"Self-organizing maps on a cluster","name":"Somoclu","note":"Don't delete this file!
